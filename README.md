# 2020 Bot Library

An Arduino library designed to be used with the 2020 Bot (http://2020bot.com).

Requires Timer One library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne).

## Warning!!!

This is a work in progress.

If you decide to experiment with this library anyways, feel free to report issues, etc., but don't expect any level of support.

Thanks for your understanding!
