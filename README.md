#2020 Bot Library#

An Arduino library designed to be used with the 2020 Bot (http://2020bot.com).

Requires Timer One library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne).

##Warning!!!##

This is a work in progress and is probablty not suitable for general use yet.

If you decide to experiment with this library anyways, feel free to report issues, etc., but don't expect any level of support.

Thanks for your understanding!
