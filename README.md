# 2020 Bot Library

An Arduino library designed to be used with the 2020 Bot (http://2020bot.com).

For the standard 2020 Bot using an Arduino Nano:
	Requires Timer One library (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne).

For the enhanced 2020 Bot using an Espressif ESP32 Dev Module:
	Requires installation of the ESP32 support for Arduino (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#using-through-arduino-ide)

## Warning!!!

This is a work in progress.

If you decide to experiment with this library anyways, feel free to report issues, etc., but don't expect any level of support.

This doesn't mean I won't help... it just means I can only help on a time available basis and priority is given to people 
I know have obtained a 2020 Bot kit directly from me.

Thanks for your understanding!
